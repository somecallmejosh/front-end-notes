The value on the left of the question mark picks which of the other two values will come out. When it is true, the middle value is chosen. When it's false, the value on the right comes out.

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log(true ? 1 : 2) // 2

console.log(false ? 1 : 2) // 2
{% endhighlight %}
